There will be a link to a page of plants listed in alphabetical order where a user can browse. If a user is logged in theyâ€™ll be able to see recommended plants under the search bar which will be randomly selected plants. If the user has saved preferences, they will see plants that are filtered based on their preferences. Under the search bar will be checkboxes to search for plants with preferences.
